# UW-LSRT
-------
####**Description**
UW LightSpeedRegistrationTool helps UW students to be the first one to register whatever class they wanted to.
####**installation**
- Python is required (my code uses python 2.7)


- Selenium need to be installed binding with python: http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

- Webdriver is required (my code is using Chrome)
Chrome:	https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
Edge:	https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
Firefox:	https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
Safari:	https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/
**important: unzip it and place it in /usr/bin(I don't know) or /usr/local/bin(works for mac user)**
Failure to observe this step will give you an error selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: ‘geckodriver’ executable needs to be in PATH.

after all above installed go to **Terminal** go to your file directory and type $ python ./UW-LSRT.py

check for errors and google it to fix(could be issue with python version or webdriver install location).
